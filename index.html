  <p>This web app has gone through a couple iterations since its inception.</p>
  <p>
    At first, all of the data was Chicago-based and spanned a number of categories, including transportation, 311 and education. However, it was unclear how this would be any more useful than
    the City of Chicago's existing data portal.
  </p>
  <p>
    As someone who frequently uses open data for research, I have always found it cumbersome to collect data from multiple cities' data portals.
    This seemed like a natural opportunity to aggregate data from several cities that one might want to analyze together in one place.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once I started bringing in other cities' data, I realized that I would need to change how I organized the data on the website. To fix this problem, I recategorized datasets by city and
    focused the range of data I provided to only 311 service data. The reason for this decision was threefold:
  </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Once I categorized data by city, it became difficult to add subcategories.</li>
      <li>Focusing on one data category now would make it easier to build on some kind of additional functionality later.</li>
      <li>311 service is a particularly interesting category of data to compare across cities.</li>
    </ol>
  <p>In the future, I hope to use the data that I've aggregated to provide some insight into what makes 311 services most effective.</p>
